	Long: `Fork a continuously running process, a daemon.
Long running processes, such as a server listening on a port, need to detach from the
parent process so that they are not killed when the parent exits.

Traditionally, this is done using fork/exec.  This is an example of how to detach
a process from the parent using exec.Command().Start() and save the pid so we can later
kill the process.`,

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
